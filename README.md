**Game Name: US State Games**

**Description:**
US State Games is an interactive game that offers an engaging way to learn and memorize the names and locations of the US states. Using the Pandas library and state data, players are given the opportunity to test their knowledge and learn to recognize states based on their geographical positions.

**Key Features:**
1. US Map Display: The game provides an interactive map of the United States that helps players visualize the locations of the states.
2. State Guessing: Players are presented with a state name or its capital, and their task is to select the corresponding state on the map. Players can choose a state by clicking on it on the map or by entering the corresponding command.
3. Creating a CSV File with Unnamed States: Upon exiting the game, a CSV file is created listing all the states that were not named or guessed by the player. This allows the player to see which states remained unfilled and pay attention to them in the next game.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas Library

**Installation and Running:**
1. Install Python 3.x if it is not already installed on your computer.
2. Install the Pandas library using the command `pip install pandas`.
